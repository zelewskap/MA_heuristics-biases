The really scary thing is before we became more populous and starting burning ghg and industrializing more and more, there is some evidence the earth was actually heading toward snowball earth. The fact we could interrupted that proves how potent ghg is and our impact is greater than we ever thought.  Enough to stop its deadly march toward a dead planet. If it went snowball like it was doing as co2 dropped more and more and the climate cooled, plants and animals would have died off, and we would be as dead as mars, and humans would never have been here.From James Hansens paper [https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/3/1/kgad008/7335889](https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/3/1/kgad008/7335889)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Prospects for another snowball EarthWe would be remiss if we did not comment on the precipitous decline of Earth’s temperature over the last several million years. Was Earth falling off the table into another Snowball Earth?Global temperature plummeted in the past 50 million years, with growing, violent, oscillations (Figs 6 and 7). Glacial-interglacial average CO2 declined from about 325 ppm to 225 ppm in the past five million years in an accelerating decline (Fig. 9a). As CO2 fell to 180 ppm during recent glacial maxima, an ice sheet covered most of Canada and reached midlatitudes in the U.S. Continents in the current supercontinent cycle \\[101\\] are now dispersed, with movement slowing to 2–3 cm/year. Emissions from the last high-speed high-impact tectonic event—collision of the Indian plate with Eurasia—are fizzling out. The most recent large igneous province (LIP) event—the Columbia River Flood Basalt about 15 million years ago (Fig. 6)—is no longer a factor, and there is no evidence of another impending LIP. Snowball conditions are possible, even though the Sun’s brightness is increasing and is now almost 6% greater \\[69\\] than it was at the last snowball Earth, almost 600 million years ago \\[68\\]. Runaway snowball likely requires only 1–2 halvings \\[66\\] of CO2 from the LGM 180 ppm level, i.e. to 45–90 ppm. Although the weathering rate declines in colder climate \\[119\\], weathering and burial of organic matter continue, so decrease of atmospheric CO2 could have continued over millions of years, if the source of CO2 from metamorphism and vulcanism continued to decline.Another factor that may have contributed to cooling in the Pliocene is uplift and poleward movement of Greenland that accelerated about 5 MyBP \\[120\\], which likely enhanced glaciation of Greenland and should be accounted for in simulations of Pliocene climate change. We conclude that, in the absence of human activity, Earth may have been headed for snowball Earth conditions within the next 10 or 20 million years, but the chance of future snowball Earth is now academic. Human-made GHG emissions remove that possibility on any time scale of practical interest.

What you're missing is that geological time scales are on the order of at least thousands, often millions of years. Yes, the planet can, has, and will sequester shit tons of CO2, and in the worst case scenario, everything will eventually recover. But this happens over thousands, tens of thousands, millions of years. The Earth was/is in a cycle of ice ages jumping between ~200-~300 ppm CO2 shifts, which occurred over multiple thousands of years. We created a shift of similar magnitude in ~150 years. The planet and the species that live on it need time to adapt to change, and if this change turns out to be too much too fast, we're in trouble.\n\nThe times these thresholds of speed and/or magnitude have been transgressed coincide with 4 of Earth's 5 mass extinctions.

I don't see a significant change since 1880, given the scatter. Other sites show somewhat different data, with a slow-down from 1950-70, attributed to new reservoirs filling up.  \n>  \n>My \"fairly stable\" comment is relative to say the rise from 11,000 to 8000 yrs ago, which was +50 m over 3000 yrs (wikipedia plot linked above), a rate of 167 mm/decade, which was 9.3 times faster than the rate for the last century. Hard to resolve in that plot, but appears the current rate has been almost constant for the last 4000 years.\n\nYou don't see a significant change because that is what you want to see. As we've discussed many times before if you place a straightedge on the curve between say 1880 and 1920 you can see the actual curve moves away from the straightedge quickly. Then place it between 2000 and 2020 and you can easily see the increasing rate. But you always ignore that discussion and continue to bring up the same false information over and over. Think I will just bookmark this one so I can just link back to it in the future and everyone can see how you ignore it. \n\nIf you use the scientific method and actually check the numbers with a best fit you will see that the last decade saw the rate was 48 mm/decade with the decade before that at 29 mm/decade. The 48 mm/decade is more than the rise in your graph from 14.5k to 20k years ago of about 20 meters which would be 36 mm/decade right before a large increase in the rates. However even during that time period you see a gradually increasing rate much like what is happening today. Sure hope the same thing doesn't happen today, but with the temperature increasing rate and the glaciers increasing melt it doesn't look good. In fact the 14.5k to 17k years ago look like a 10 meter increase. That's a rate of 40 mm/decade which is amazingly close to what happened last decade.

We have been on a technological parabola ride for a long time. The nature of the exponential is that the rate of change will keep getting faster. The next few years will probably be mind-blowing for many people. As will the years after that. But so have the last decades been. Focusing solely on the binary questions of \"what will the singularity be like\" or \"when will it arrive\" ignores the fact that we are already on the ride.\n\nThis hit home for me in a concrete way when (of all things) I was watching Fiddler on the Roof a couple days ago. I would encourage you to go watch the opening scene of the movie (with the song \"Tradition\"). Look at the way of life and objects in this fictional (but realistically constructed) Russian town. Fiddler on the Roof is set in roughly 1905 in the town of Anatevka in the Russian Empire. A time traveler from the year 1500, or the year 1000 or the year 1, or even the year 1000 BCE would encounter basically familiar objects, customs, and people in Anatevka. It would be a world that is foreign, very (relatively) technologically advanced, but completely understandable and relatable. On the other hand, take someone from Anatevka and plop them down in 2024 Brooklyn, and they'd be entering a world which is not just foreign, but overwhelming, frightening, and unintelligible. To an ancient Athenian from 500 BC nothing in Anatevka would look like magic; but to a Russian peasant from 1900 everything in Times Square would.\n\nThat's exponential change. We're in it right now, and we've been in it for longer than you're alive. \n\nThere may come a time when you personally feel \"woah, now *this* is exponential change.\"\n\nBut just don't forget that based on all objective measures we're already there and have been for a while.","platform":"Reddit","topic":"AI","affect_h_bs":null,"availability_h_bs":null,"representativeness_h_bs":null,"confirmation_b_bs":null,"all_or_nothing_bs":null,"affect_h_fs":1,"availability_h_fs":null,"representativeness_h_fs":null,"confirmation_b_fs":null,"all_or_nothing_fs":null,"affect_h_ir":1,"availability_h_ir":null,"representativeness_h_ir":"nan","confirmation_b_ir":null,"all_or_nothing_ir":1,"affect_h_wl":null,"availability_h_wl":null,"representativeness_h_wl":null,"confirmation_b_wl":null,"all_or_nothing_wl":null,"Conversation ID":"nan","Tweet ID":"nan","Author ID":"nan","Created At":"nan","disagreed_biases":"affect_h"},{"title":"nan","post_id_x":"1b0hq9p","comment_id":"ks8jnrw","comment_author":"Cr4zko","text":"I just want FDVR to enjoy good booze like Aberlour and live in my favorite anime.","platform":"Reddit","topic":"AI","affect_h_bs":null,"availability_h_bs":null,"representativeness_h_bs":null,"confirmation_b_bs":null,"all_or_nothing_bs":null,"affect_h_fs":1,"availability_h_fs":null,"representativeness_h_fs":null,"confirmation_b_fs":null,"all_or_nothing_fs":null,"affect_h_ir":1,"availability_h_ir":null,"representativeness_h_ir":"nan","confirmation_b_ir":null,"all_or_nothing_ir":null,"affect_h_wl":null,"availability_h_wl":null,"representativeness_h_wl":null,"confirmation_b_wl":null,"all_or_nothing_wl":null,"Conversation ID":"nan","Tweet ID":"nan","Author ID":"nan","Created At":"nan","disagreed_biases":"affect_h"},{"title":"nan","post_id_x":"1b0hq9p","comment_id":"ks8kqhw","comment_author":"Witty-Exit-5176","text":"In a time where libraries are being censored in a mass, including science books, we shouldn't do that.\n\n(Half of the states within the US are defunding their libraries, pulling out of the American Library Association, and instituting book bans because those books contained information, perspectives, etc. that went against their political ideologies.

They do it to pretty much every new machine that causes efficiency improvements because they're afraid of layoffs. It's a reasonable fear, some of those efficiency improvements do actually cause layoffs, but the sabotage only hurts union negotiations for severance benefits\n\nAdmittedly, if they don't have a union, there's no reason not to. Spite is a driving motivation as well. It's cheaper to do things amicably, and the factories who don't understand that will lose more than the factories that do\n\nIt's gonna be a really big difference too, because being replaced by something humanoid just hits different than if it's a big metal box of some kind. Like, normally the sabotage would be small things that could have been accidental, but this shit could inspire straight up arson if the workers are disgruntled enough by how management (mis)manages everything. That still won't stop adoption of the technology, cheaper and better is cheaper and better, but it's gonna cost you a few hundred million dollars in production losses alone\n\nThey're not gonna realize this by themselves, either.

Raw statistics implies that some of them will cheap out on the consultant, or maybe nepotism or something like that means they hire a bad consultant\n\nWe'll probably see some fireworks on the news, hopefully not in an actual fireworks factory.

It's amazing as a staring point if you have no idea if it is even remotely possible. I've gotten over the \"garbage in\" problems by just throwing it at GPT-4, and it is very good at dealing with it, so 100% agreed on that point.\n\nI use GPT-4 in the first case then try and replicate the output using 3.5, I've been able to do it in like 80% of cases and I'm not convinced the last 20% isn't just me being a dumbass. I think of it through the framing of the old parable: \"You're not finished when you've added everything you can think of. You're finished when you can't take anything else away.\" \n\nI do find that the more i work with 3.5, the luckier i get, though. \n\nI wish that they'd let us look under the hood and know exactly what it i,  but MoE is the best approximation we've got. I've been looking into various architectures people are building,  and everything interesting is just MoE++ where they add a recursive thought proces,  etc. \n\nYou were wonderful to discuss this with.

There seems to be a need for you alarmist types to ignore anything that goes against your hopes and dreams of the oceans boiling.

I care about if I can afford my expense now bot decades later I might be dead by then.","platform":"Reddit","topic":"CC","affect_h_bs":"nan","availability_h_bs":"nan","representativeness_h_bs":"nan","confirmation_b_bs":"nan","all_or_nothing_bs":"nan","affect_h_fs":1,"availability_h_fs":1,"representativeness_h_fs":"nan","confirmation_b_fs":"nan","all_or_nothing_fs":"nan","affect_h_ir":1,"availability_h_ir":"nan","representativeness_h_ir":"nan","confirmation_b_ir":"nan","all_or_nothing_ir":"nan","affect_h_wl":"nan","availability_h_wl":"nan","representativeness_h_wl":"nan","confirmation_b_wl":"nan","all_or_nothing_wl":"nan","Conversation ID":"nan","Tweet ID":"nan","Author ID":"nan","Created At":"nan","gold_biases":"affect_h","_deepnote_index_column":29},{"title":"nan","post_id_x":"1asc8ph","comment_id":"kqw79c3","comment_author":"hot_pink_bunny202","text":"Yea maybe 5yrs 10yrs 30yrs from now.

I grew up a block from the abandoned Second Welland Canal during the 50s and 60s. It was used as an open sewer by the municipality and various industries including paper mills. At Port Dalhousie, where the Canal emptied into Lake Ontario, dead fish washed up onto the beach in great numbers. Bulldozers were used to remove them. As an added touch, there was an large garbage incinerator nearby, not much more than a mile from downtown St. Catharines.  Thanks to belated regulations, the situation is much better now. I'm sure there were many worse sites.

What you're missing is that geological time scales are on the order of at least thousands, often millions of years. Yes, the planet can, has, and will sequester shit tons of CO2, and in the worst case scenario, everything will eventually recover. But this happens over thousands, tens of thousands, millions of years. The Earth was/is in a cycle of ice ages jumping between ~200-~300 ppm CO2 shifts, which occurred over multiple thousands of years. We created a shift of similar magnitude in ~150 years. The planet and the species that live on it need time to adapt to change, and if this change turns out to be too much too fast, we're in trouble.\n\nThe times these thresholds of speed and/or magnitude have been transgressed coincide with 4 of Earth's 5 mass extinctions.

At Port Dalhousie, where the Canal emptied into Lake Ontario, dead fish washed up onto the beach in great numbers. Bulldozers were used to remove them. As an added touch, there was an large garbage incinerator nearby, not much more than a mile from downtown St. Catharines.  Thanks to belated regulations, the situation is much better now.

But this happens over thousands, tens of thousands, millions of years. The Earth was/is in a cycle of ice ages jumping between ~200-~300 ppm CO2 shifts, which occurred over multiple thousands of years. We created a shift of similar magnitude in ~150 years.
